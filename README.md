### Development Guidelines
- Write comments and documentation when appropriate for better clarity.
- Avoid writing untyped JavaScript. Use TypeScript whenever possible.
- When styling elements using CSS, try to achieve the intended layout using a minimal number of properties. Try not to declare redundant properties.
- When you get to the quiz submission part of the project, we will provide relevant API endpoints with documentation for you to use.
